            SQL Injection

          In light of the recent scandal facing Ashley Madison, we can log yet another episode of hacking on a massive scale. It seems to me that there's been one of these hacking stories at least once every several months. However, it's not just the "big guys" who are vulnerable--it's also smaller websites that are at risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          One common hacking tool I'd like to highlight is SQL Injection. As the name implies, it relies on a hacker to use SQL statements to query and even change the databases that support web apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, let's say we had login form for a web app. Behind most forms are SQL statements kind of like this:
        </p>
        <code>
          SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = "Some-Name"
        </code>
        <p>
          If we were somebody with malicious intent, we could add an extra quotation mark and put additional commands into the username field of the form:
        </p>
        <code>
          Chris""; DELETE * FROM table_name;
        </code>
        <p>
          This results in the true SQL statement below:
        </p>
        <code>
          SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = "Chris""; DELETE * FROM table_name;
        </code>
        <p>
          Essentially what we're doing here is deleting all records from a table.
        </p>
        <p>
          How do we counter this? We can use escapes like putting a \ before quotations before the command is sent to the database. We can also use "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement">prepared statements</a>."
        </p>
        <p>
          SQL injections are devastatingly simple in their execution and represent a major vulnerability in how database querying is performed. As developers and as we launch a web app, it'll be imperative to check for these weaknesses else risk our careers.
