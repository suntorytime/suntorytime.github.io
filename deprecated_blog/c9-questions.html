          As I dive deeper into my development career, I'm starting to realize the value and importance of the online community to get things done. What I mean by this is that I probably would have been stuck on a coding challenge if it hadn't been for others who asked questions on Quora or Stack Overflow and had them answered.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can't however pose a question willy-nilly. There's a considered methodology of sorts that can make our questions more understandable and the answers we receive more helpful. Here are some tips I compiled that can help us with this:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>In the question header, describe the problem concisely</li>
            <li>Introduce the problem before any code</li>
            <li>Post only the most relevant part of your code</li>
            <li>Employ tags (of posts) to help describe and archive your question</li>
            <li>Proof-read</li>
            <li>Respond to feedback</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          With these tips in mind, we can help make the development community more productive not just for everybody else but for yourself too!
