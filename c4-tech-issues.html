            On-demand Failure

          There's a <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/248896">lot of talk</a> these days about the sobering future of the on-demand industry and the failure of Homejoy. So what were the contributing factors to the demise of some of these startups? Well, contractor-vs-employee legal issues and overgrowth are some key citations of their demise.To add my two cents though I think other important factors to mention are 1) confidence in the core product and 2) confidence in the larger mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          To take example of Homejoy again, let's step back and look at it for a minute. Its core product is an on-demand cleaning service for homes. Sure it got a tremendous amount of seed funding from VCs to operate for awhile and I'm sure some people got rich; but as a 20-something-year old from the Bay Area looking for employment after my stint at Dev Bootcamp, home cleaning doesn't strike me as a service that I'm particularly passionate about to work towards. I wouldn't be surprised if there are many other workers my age who feel the same way.

          You might say--Homejoy wasn't just about cleaning; it had a larger mission to expand to other aspects of home improvement. To the average consumer, I don't think that was communicated very well nor did consumers care if the core product wasn't delivered well (now citing issues with Homejoy's quality of cleaning homes). In contrast, I think tech companies that communicate their larger-than-life mission effectively include the likes of Microsoft, Google and Apple. Microsoft espouses it helps people be productive; Google wants to organize all the world's information; Apple uses design simplicity to deliver innovative products.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start-ups by their very nature stand on shaky grounds. They can have all the tech talent and funding they want, but if the fundamentals like confidence in the core product and mission aren't there, it's probably best to take your business or employment prospects elsewhere.
