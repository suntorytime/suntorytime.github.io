      Hey development community!
my name is Steven Santa Maria, a local San Franciscan, Japanese sake enthusiast and budding coder.
I started Dev Bootcamp this week with an introduction to the basics including how to use git, GitHub, command line navigation, Twitter and  other tools.
For those who are starting their journey into the world of coding like me, I thought I’d share some thoughts on some FAQ:
</p>
<b>What are the benefits of version control?</b>
<p>
Version control allows collaborators to track changes and revert unwanted changes. Using git and GitHub are commonly used tools for version control.
</p>
<b>How does git help you keep track of changes?</b>
<p>
Git is a version control system that’s widely used in the dev community. As you ‘add’ and ‘commit,’ git stores a log of changes for easy reference.
</p>
<b>Why use GitHub to store your code?</b>
<p>
GitHub is a great and free tool to use if you want to use git collaboratively. It can be used to store code online, host websites like the one you’re viewing and essentially get team members on the same page in terms of versioning.
