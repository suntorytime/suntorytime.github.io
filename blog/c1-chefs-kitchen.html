    Hey DBC community

Recently, I had the opportunity to get a better understanding of DBC’s culture though a <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014>fireside chat with Shereef</a>. In many ways it’s unique in that it stresses the emotional attitude one should have entering DBC.

Here is how I approach other aspects of the culture at DBC:

Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience?
<p>
I feel that the DBC experience is up my alley. For many years, I thought coding was a skill that I simply could not approach because I didn’t have the foresight to have taken it during my high school or undergraduate careers. According to the fireside chat, DBC fosters a democratic, collaborative learning environment.

<b>
What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
</b>
<p>
DBC’s learning environment seems to be enabled by the culture already present and our active participation in that culture. The tools of how to succeed culturally are present in the curriculum—I will keep current with the material and engage with my cohort and others outside my cohort.
</p>
<b>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</b>
<p>
It makes me excited to participate in this learning environment because I will be joining others who are roughly at the same skill level as I am.
