            Disengaging the Autopilot

          I haven't finished Dev Bootcamp yet but I can say it was a challenge getting to this point at all. I feel like I was on autopilot for most of life. Sure, this "autopilot" led me to a comfy position at a reputable company prior to DBC. However, despite my comfort, what I slowly realized and disappointed me was my lack of agency. The tech sphere always interested me but I somehow felt joining it wasn't attainable. As I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk">Claude M. Steele's presentation on "Identity and Stereotype Threat"<a>, I suspect my hesitation was related to certain societal cues.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Steele's talk, he mentions:
        </p>
        <p>
        <blockquote>
          "By affecting the comfort level and performance pressure that we feel in specific situations and in entire walks of life, identity contingencies can affect both specific performances and life defining choices of careers, relationships, regions of the country to live in, etc."
        </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a powerful statement and one that I can link to in my personal history. For one, I became involved in the big biotech world because it seemed like a responsible thing to do. A lot of my friends (who were mostly Asian Americans) majored in the biosciences. As I later entered the biotech workforce, I saw a lot of people like me. As Steele alludes to in his lecture, I must have been subtly reinforced to stick around because of this observation. Lingering in my gut however was still this weird feeling that I should be doing something else career-wise.
        </p>

          I think Steele makes a good point in that salience of the subtle societal cues helps us break away from default assignments. My entrance into the world of web development (and, in many ways, the world of creativity!) is not only a shift to a new field I enjoy but also an attempt to regain a sense of true agency.
