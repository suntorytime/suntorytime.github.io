          Bingo. A timeless game of chance and profitable <a href="http://www.livingdharma.org/CurrentEvents/Obon2003Pics/Obon03-Bingo.jpeg">fundraisers for non-profits</a>. But! the game can be an awesome illustration of the value of Classes in Ruby.
        </p>
<p>
          As with any bingo game, as a player, we need a board. Heck, I have one in my pocket right here:
        </p>
          <code>
            board = <br>
            [[47, 44, 71, 8, 88],<br>
            [22, 69, 75, 65, 73],<br>
            [83, 85, 97, 89, 57],<br>
            [25, 31, 96, 68, 51],<br>
            [75, 70, 54, 80, 83]]<br>
          </code>
<p>
          Bingo boards look awful like arrays, don't they? This will come into play later in our code.
</p>
<p>
          First we'll want to declare a new class. Let's call it "BingoBoard" and we'll initialize our pocket-sized board.
        </p>
          <code>
            class BingoBoard<br><br>

            def initialize(board)<br>
              @bingo_board = board<br>
            end
          </code>
          <p>
          We can't have a bingo game without those balls that go round-and-round in the cage. Let's make a method for our BingoBoard class.
          </p>
          <code>
          def generate_ball<br>
            bingo_array = %w(b i n g o)<br>
            @letter = bingo_array.sample<br>
            @number = rand(100)<br>
            puts "You got #{@letter}, #{@number}!"<br>
          end
          </code>
          <p>
          Equally crucial, we need a new method to check the result of "generate_ball" against the board. How do we do that? true to the programming world, there are many ways to do it. This is what I came up with:
        </p>
          <code>
              def check<br>
                raise ArgumentError, "You need to generate a ball<br>first!" if @letter == nil || @number == nil<br>

                bingo_hash = { "b"=>0, "i"=>1, "n"=>2, "g"=>3, "o"=>4 }<br>
                check_for_letter = bingo_hash[@letter]<br>
                @bingo_board.map {|outside_element|<br>
                if outside_element.kind_of?(Array)<br>
                    outside_element[check_for_letter] = "X" if outside_element[check_for_letter] == @number<br>
                end }<br>
                @bingo_board.map { |outside_element| puts outside_element.inspect }<br>
              end
            </code>
            <p>
          For the sake of convenience, we'll want a third method to display our board. Let's call it "display_board".
        </p>
          <code>
          def display_board<br>
            @bingo_board.map { |outside_element| puts outside_element.inspect }<br>
          end<br>
          end # this ends the Class definition
        </code>
        <p>
          It's a fair amount of code and I don't want to get into the details of it. What I do want to highlight however is how it all comes together. We have Class called BingoBoard that has all the functions required: a way to "generate_ball", to "check" the ball against the board, and a method to "display_board".
</p>
<p>
          To put it another way, Classes help organize our code into more cohesive stories. The story is changed by invoking a different board!
</p>
<p>
          Classes are sometimes hard to wrap our minds around at first. However, stick with them--! they're important for function and context!
