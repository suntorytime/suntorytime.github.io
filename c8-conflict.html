          When I was in my last job, I remember feeling angry and disappointed during one of my people review sessions. "Steven, you did a great job this year," my manager said. "We did however receive some comments that you could improve your communication." What the heck does that mean?
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though I felt that I was on copasetic terms with many of my coworkers, some thought I was too distant and some others thought I sent emails with a condescending tone. This hurt me because after some years in Toastmasters I thought I would know how to be sensitive to my communication style. The hurt quickly turned into disappointment and anger. Sure, my emails and general communication style were as 'neutrally professional' as I could make them, but isn't this part of corporate culture? It certainly wasn't my intention to condescend others.

          After digging into it a little bit more, I realized that sometimes 'profesional' tones is not the best way to communicate. I changed my email style and chatted more with my coworkers; and eventually I received some heartwarming compliments on the change. I was disappointed with the criticisms I received, but sometimes letting the barriers down is what it takes to better the team.
