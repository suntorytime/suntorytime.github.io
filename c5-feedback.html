          Here I thought I was going to learn nothing but coding and maybe <a href="http://blog.devbootcamp.com/2015/namaste-coders-yoga-dev-bootcamp-2/">a little yoga</a>. Five weeks in though, one of the more surprising things about Dev Bootcamp is the curriculum's focus on giving and receiving feedback. This focus makes a lot of sense after some personal reflection.
</p>
<p>
          I tried to get into coding several times unsuccessfully. Every time I dabbled, I dropped it because of other commitments or, frankly, lack of support. I didn't have anybody to bounce ideas off of, or to ask questions to. I was working in a vacuum. No wonder I gave up so easily those times!
</p>
<p>
          I feel like it's different at DBC because the culture of feedback lends to the teamwork. For example, at a pairing session this week, I received some advice that I should be more assertive when I have a viable solution. We also completed the challenge just above the stated average time. During a more recent pairing session, and addressing the earlier advice, my peer and I finished 30 minutes sooner than the average duration. Not bad!
</p>
<p>
          It's sometimes difficult to receive the feedback. However, I usually try to take a step back, suck it up, and understand that the my hurt emotions are extremely temporal. In the end, I will have gained a valuable skill.
