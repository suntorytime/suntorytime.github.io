          When I first thought about getting into a coding bootcamp like Dev Bootcamp, I didn't know the difference between one programming language from the next. I frankly got into Ruby as it was one of the default languages taught in DBC. I learned eventually that some languages can be considered Object-Oriented and some others Functional. What do these categories mean and why are they significant?

          I recently bought a vinyl player to play some of my dad's LPs including albums by ol' Frank Sinatra, Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, etc; it's a lot of great music and it's fun to get that spinning along with some glasses of whisky and friends. <a href="t4-enumerable-methods.html">Read More</a>

            I haven't finished Dev Bootcamp yet but I can say it was a challenge getting to this point at all. I feel like I was on autopilot for most of life. Sure, this "autopilot" led me to a comfy position at a reputable company prior to DBC. However, despite my comfort, what I slowly realized and disappointed me was my lack of agency. <a href="c6-stereotype-threat.html">Read More</a>
