          Recently in our Dev Bootcamp course, we jumped out of the world of Ruby and plopped into Javascript. There are definitely many similarities between Ruby and JavaScript thankfully; and as a result, making the syntatic and logical transition from the former is easier than I expected. One difference, however, that caught my attention was the relationship between Ruby hashes and JavaScript objects.

          When I first thought about getting into a coding bootcamp like Dev Bootcamp, I didn't know the difference between one programming language from the next. I frankly got into Ruby as it was one of the default languages taught in DBC. I learned eventually that some languages can be considered Object-Oriented and some others Functional. What do these categories mean and why are they significant? <a href="t6-oop-concepts.html">Read More</a>

            On the heels of my last blog post on stereotyping and how an "autopilot" took over me for many years, I thought I'd do a meta-analysis on my personal values. Why? Because sometimes life passes us by and we're no happier now compared to square one. <a href="c7-values.html">Read More</a>
