          Prior to starting work on the very site you're looking at, I learned the basics of a 'class' and 'id.' However, how could these concepts help get my site from a 1990s style build to a what-I-call-mid-2010-contemporary style?
        </p>
        <p>
          As you might expect, even a basic website will have many lines of HTML code. It will also have almost equally many lines of CSS code to help style the website. What can help streamline our CSS stylesheet is to use the 'class' and 'id,' which are essentially selectors. They help us target and style certain HTML elements on our pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when should we use one versus the other?
        </p>
        <p>
          To put it simply, a class is meant to be used multiple times on a single HTML page. The id is used only once.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, if we designed a navigation bar, I wouldn't use an id to style this. Presumably, we would have multiple list items with consistent style, so a class is more appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, by knowing the value of using the CSS selectors class and id, we can develop more helpful and streamlined code.
