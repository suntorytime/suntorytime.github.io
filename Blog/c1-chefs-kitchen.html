            Impressions on DBC's Learning Culture
          </div>

        <p>
        Recently, I had the opportunity to get a better understanding of DBC's culture though a <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">fireside chat with Shereef</a>. In many ways it's unique in that it stresses the emotional attitude one should have entering DBC.
        </p>
        <p>
        Here is how I approach other aspects of the culture at DBC:
        </p>
        <b>Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience?</b>
        <p>
        I feel that the DBC experience is up my alley. For many years, I thought coding was a skill that I simply could not approach because I didn't have the foresight to have taken it during my high school or undergraduate careers. According to the fireside chat, DBC fosters a democratic, collaborative learning environment.
        </p>
        <b>
        What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
        </b>
        <p>
        DBC's learning environment seems to be enabled by the culture already present and our active participation in that culture. The tools of how to succeed culturally are present in the curriculumâ€”I will keep current with the material and engage with my cohort and others outside my cohort.
        </p>
        <b>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</b>
        <p>
        It makes me excited to participate in this learning environment because I will be joining others who are roughly at the same skill level as I am.
